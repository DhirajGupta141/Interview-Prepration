An image is represented by a 2-D array of integers, each integer representing the pixel value of the image.

Given a coordinate (sr, sc) representing the starting pixel (row and column) of the flood fill, and a pixel value newColor, "flood fill" the image.

To perform a "flood fill", consider the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to the starting pixel of the same color as the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to those pixels (also with the same color as the starting pixel), and so on. Replace the color of all of the aforementioned pixels with the newColor.

Example 1:

Input: image = {{1,1,1},{1,1,0},{1,0,1}},
sr = 1, sc = 1, newColor = 2.
Output: {{2,2,2},{2,2,0},{2,0,1}}
Explanation: From the center of the image 
(with position (sr, sc) = (1, 1)), all 
pixels connected by a path of the same color
as the starting pixel are colored with the new 
color.Note the bottom corner is not colored 2, 
because it is not 4-directionally connected to 
the starting pixel.
