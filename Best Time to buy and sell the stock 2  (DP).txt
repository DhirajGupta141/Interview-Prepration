Say you have an array, A, for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).

However, you may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).

Input Format:

The first and the only argument is an array of integer, A.
Output Format:

Return an integer, representing the maximum possible profit.
Constraints:

1 <= len(A) <= 1e5
1 <= A[i] <= 1e7
Example :

Input 1:
    A = [1, 2, 3]

Output 1:
    2

Explanation 1:
    => Buy a stock on day 0.
    => Sell the stock on day 1. (Profit +1)
    => Buy a stock on day 1.
    => Sell the stock on day 2. (Profit +1)
    
    Overall profit = 2

Input 2:
    A = [5, 2, 10]

Output 2:
    8

Explanation 2:
    => Buy a stock on day 1.
    => Sell the stock on on day 2. (Profit +8)
    
    Overall profit = 8
__________________________________________________SOLUTION_____________________________
//It is given that we could do as many transaction as we want 
// So the Maximum profit will only happen if we do as many transaction as possible
// so this will be possible when we buy the stock at i and sell it on i+1 if a[i+1]>a[i]
// this will lead to n-1 transaction where n is the length of the array

public class Solution
{
    // DO NOT MODIFY THE ARGUMENTS WITH "final" PREFIX. IT IS READ ONLY
    public int maxProfit(final int[] a)
    {
        if(a==null || a.length<=1)
        {
            return 0;
        }
        
        int ans=0;
        for(int i=1;i<a.length;i++)
        {
            if(a[i]>a[i-1])
            {
                ans=ans+(a[i]-a[i-1]);
            }
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
}
