Given a connected undirected graph. Perform a Depth First Traversal of the graph.
Note: Use recursive approach to find the DFS traversal of the graph starting from the 0th vertex from left to right according to the graph..


Example 1:

Input:

Output: 0 1 2 4 3
Explanation: 
0 is connected to 1, 2, 4.
1 is connected to 0.
2 is connected to 0.
3 is connected to 0.
4 is connected to 0, 3.
so starting from 0, it will go to 1 then 2
then 4, and then from 4 to 3.
Thus dfs will be 0 1 2 4 3.
Example 2:

Input:

Output: 0 1 2 3
Explanation:
0 is connected to 1 , 3.
1 is connected to 2. 
2 is connected to 1.
3 is connected to 0. 
so starting from 0, it will go to 1 then 2
then back to 0 then 0 to 3
thus dfs will be 0 1 2 3.
